Student dormitory management system is a Chinese management web page that I made after learning ICS211 and following teaching videos.

Student dormitory management system, is the use of Java Web implementation. I created this website to achieve login and add student information and other basic management functions.

In this project, I gained relevant experience in Web production and a deeper knowledge of Java, and it was the first project I did besides making projects in the course.
