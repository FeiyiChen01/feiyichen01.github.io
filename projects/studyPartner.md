Study Partner is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.

ICS students can log in their personal information and the courses they need help with, or are able to help with. They can get or give more help to other students by creating or joining a session. And the sessions they join will be displayed on the calendar page for easier viewing with students. In addition, we also designed a score panel, where students can get scores by joining or creating meetings. The three students with the highest score will be displayed on the page of the leader board. Students are free to choose the images on their profile page and session page. When students need any help or encounter various problems, they can contact us through the contact admin page, and we will try our best to provide the necessary help.

Study Partner can be used as a development template for developers to use.

The Study Partner has been deployed on the Digital Ocean.

Deployed application can be found at https://study-partner.xyz/.
