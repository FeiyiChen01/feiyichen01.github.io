By revising the drawings, one was made from materials available at home. 
Whenever I meet a lot of interesting people, 
I wish I could have a speaker to amplify the volume of my phone. Buying a speaker was too expensive for me, 
so I started thinking about making my own. I made a drawing of my own speaker by searching on the Internet. 
Reuse extra wood planks at home and buy any other materials you need online.
