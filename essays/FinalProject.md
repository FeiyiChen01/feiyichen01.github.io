## Food Star Application

## Overview:
Problem: There are very few kinds of cafeteria in Hawaii. Many students walk into the cafeteria and don't know what they need to buy to eat. They don't have a good recommendation.
<br />
Solution: The app allows students to freely comment on existing foods and offer suggestions and recipes for new foods. Businesses will also be able to make better sales and take reservations on the site.

## Mockup pages include:
Landing page
User home page
Admin home page
User Profile page
Sign up/Sign in
Store Page
List Item page(Nutrient content Pie Chart)
Create item page
Make offer on item page
Blog page

## Use case ideas
New user goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign up”, sets up a profile, and is redirected back to the landing page (with expanded details about each project now visible).
User goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign in”, enters their credentials, and is redirected to the landing page. They have the ability to edit any project pages that they are a part of.
Admin goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign in”, enters their credentials, and is redirected to the landing page. They have the ability to update any project page and the website structure.
