## Reflect on Javascript 1

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/Reflection.png"> So far, I've been learning JavaScript for almost two weeks. JavaScript is ideal for beginners like me. It does not require tedious work such as setting up the development environment. Newcomers can jump in and start learning programming. JavaScript is by far the simplest for me compared to other programming languages. All I had to do was create some well-understood functions and finish up a maximum of 10 hours of JavaScript tutorials. Many of the JavaScript tutorials are similar to the Java language I learned earlier. JavaScript allowed me to actually learn programming languages on Chrome without having to deal with a cumbersome compiler.

In the WOD exercise of ICS314, I was able to learn JavaScript and related skills very well. This kind of regular practice, I think, is not just for programming languages, I think it can be useful in any area of learning. I rely on timers to give myself an upper bound on how much time I need to think and program. Can let me have a good self-cognition. In this way, I can better improve my programming speed and the use of JavaScript proficiency. In this process, it is true that there will be pressure, I need to complete the thinking and coding of the topic in a specific time. This is undoubtedly a repeated process. But this process is also how I become stronger.

JavaScript is definitely a good programming language for me, and it's part of the foundation of the web. Even though many programmers think JavaScript is a bad programming language. But it will emerge with a high degree of flexibility.

Exercise software engineering allowed me to get more exercise by creating a sense of urgency. Not to get better grades, but to get better. I think this way of learning is very meaningful. We have WOD almost every day except weekends. WODs allow me to get the most exercise in the least amount of time. It's very useful.
