<h2 id="technology-connects-life">Technology Connects Life</h2>

<p>    This semester I learned a lot about the basic concepts of software engineering, and it has been interesting to apply this knowledge to web application development. My team and I managed and developed our projects by applying basic knowledge of software engineering. As we watched pages that didn’t exist get created bit by bit, we designed it, developed it, ran it, and built a database to support it. These results make us happy.</p>

<p>    During the production process, we used different project management styles and different design patterns. These ways of thinking don’t just apply to software development or web design. It’s an act that reinforces the way we think. By applying my knowledge of software engineering, I was able to better think about the overall framework of what I was going to do. I can have a better plan to get my things done. And through Design Patterns, I can also improve my aesthetic, or artistic field.</p>

<p>    Configuration Management is the process of maintaining systems, such as computer hardware and software, in a desired state. Configuration Management (CM) is another method for ensuring that systems perform consistently with expectations over time. My body is like a computer system. I need to manage my body in the same way that I need to manage my computer hardware and software to keep it in the state it needs to be. I need to keep my body in a state that is healthy and capable of fulfilling the activities of daily living.</p>

<p>    A coding standard is a set of rules that unify the appearance of code, make it clear, easy to read, and more efficient. This is a good premise for me to communicate with my team members. We’ll be able to read code written by others more easily, and we’ll be able to communicate more easily. We can increase our relationship while improving our work efficiency.</p>

<p>    The operation of software engineering is often not only the construction of network technology, it is often linked to our daily life.</p>
