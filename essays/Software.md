## Software development is a universal skill

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/Software1.gif"> We think of math, biology, and chemistry as the basis for learning all kinds of other majors
, and programming is no different. We need to do it mathematically
, but in the modern world all kinds of complex engineering problems have to be calculated by programming
. How can calculators and paper and pen meet real world problems?
Programming has become the cornerstone of all kinds of engineering
, medical, biological, chemical, and materials. From atomic bomb simulations to rocket launches to Uber.

## Software development is an art

Can you recall the first time you played a game?        <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/Software2.jpeg">
How many people are motivated to become game developers through their interest in games. 
Although software development is a career, developers can feel a sense of accomplishment when the screen displays colorful images. 
Think about the sense of accomplishment that you've created a program that's serving millions, millions of people.

## The future of software engineering

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/Software3.jpeg"> Our society is becoming a technology driven, in the past, or begin from 2000, 
the development of the Internet industry is absolutely outstanding, 
the reason is that the bottom layer of disruptive technology, 
namely the erupting development of information technology, 
from the military science and technology into commercial applications, 
this is almost the global rise of the Internet industry. 
Almost all the "Internet" that we see now is the result of the development of related industries driven by Internet technology. 
In the next decade or two, we think that this technology is going to continue and that the development of computers and 
the Internet is going to be an important driving force for the development of society. 
Although our society is constantly informationized, the level of informatization in many fields is still 
not high and the development is not complete. Software engineering is a discipline with great demand and vigorous development.

In the future, I would like to have experience and skills in game development. 
I think it's every game lover's dream to develop a game of their own. And I have experience in art and painting. 
Develop, model, and draw a game of my own, a character of my own, a character that commemorates the important people around me.
